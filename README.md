# DDB Page Numbers

A browser extension to make it easy to reference "phb page 213" to the online resources of dndbeyond.

# Feature Roadmap

1. Map pages to dndbeyond.com compendium
  - There is much work already done by @plutoneld here: [plutoneld/minimalist-ddb](https://github.com/plutoneld/minimalist-ddb)
  - Best way would be a JSON or YAML file with each mapping for ease of use and extendability
2. Add a way to go to a certain page
  - Presumably a little popover from the extension
  - Would be cool if you could enter `phb 123` in the browser bar, too!

# Nice to have

1. Insert the chapter numbers to dndbeyond.com compendium (e.g. [PHB](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb))
  - Depending on where it makes most sense because space might be tight
