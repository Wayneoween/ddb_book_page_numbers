# DDB Page Numbers

A browser extension to make it easy to reference "phb page 213" to the online resources of dndbeyond.

# Features

- [x] Map pages to dndbeyond.com compendium
   - There is much work already done by @plutoneld here: [plutoneld/minimalist-ddb](https://github.com/plutoneld/minimalist-ddb)
   - I simply reused his work that went into the JSON, thanks!
- [x] Add a way to go to a certain page
   - You can type `ddb` in the URL bar, then the book and then the page number.
   - Might be necessary to select `Pagenumbers for D&DBeyond` with one arrow-down press or so.

# Nice to have

- [ ] Insert the chapter numbers to dndbeyond.com compendium (e.g. [PHB](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb))
   - Depending on where it makes most sense because space might be tight

# Help needed

Currently there are only 5 books supported:

1. PHB
2. DMG
3. MM
4. XGTE
5. SCAG

If you want to help and have the time on your hand you could create an index like https://github.com/Wayneoween/ddb_book_page_numbers/blob/main/unused_data/phb.yaml I will gladly build the support for those books as well!
